## Sources and Approaches
# How Historians Read Medieval Jewish Culture

**Medieval Jewish Cultures and Their Afterlives — Lecture 1**

<!-- This is the title slide. Welcome students, outline the plan: we will survey where medieval Jews lived, what sources survive, and what frameworks historians use to make sense of them. Emphasise that no prior knowledge of Hebrew or Jewish history is assumed. -->

---

# Where Did Medieval Jews Live?

- **Late Antiquity → Early Middle Ages**: Jewish life centred in the Land of Israel and Babylonia (modern Iraq)
- After the **Muslim conquests (7th c.)**, centres shift to **North Africa, Iberia, and eventually northern Europe**

<v-click>

- **Muslim lands**: Baghdad, Cairo/Fustat, Kairouan, al-Andalus (Cordoba, Granada)
- **Sefarad** (Iberian Peninsula): under both Muslim and Christian rule; Toledo, Barcelona, Zaragoza
- **Provence / southern France**: Narbonne, Montpellier, Lunel — a cultural bridge zone
- **Ashkenaz** (Germany & central Europe): Mainz, Worms, Speyer, Cologne, Prague, Regensburg
- **Tsarfat** (northern France & England): Troyes, Rouen, Paris; London, York, Norwich
- **Italy**: ancient communities in the south (Otranto, Bari, Palermo); Rome; late medieval migration northward

</v-click>

<!-- Stress that "medieval Jewish world" spans from England to Iraq, not a single place. The terminology (Sefarad, Ashkenaz, Tsarfat) comes from the communities themselves. Mention that we'll look at a map in the next slide. -->

---

## The Demographic Arc

Three broad phases:

| Phase | Period | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| Early medieval low | to c. 800 | Decline; continuity mainly around the Mediterranean |
| Central medieval growth | c. 900–1300 | Population rise, paralleling general European trends |
| Late medieval decline | after c. 1300 | Expulsions, forced conversions, persecution |

<v-click>

- Jews were always a **small minority** — typically < 1 % of the total population
- In specific towns they could constitute **5–10 %** of inhabitants
- **Expulsions** redrew the map repeatedly: England 1290, France 1306/1394, Spain 1492, Portugal 1497, Sicily 1492–93, and dozens of German and Italian towns in the 15th–16th c.

</v-click>

<!-- Use the population table from Toch's chapter. Emphasise that numbers are approximate and debated. The key takeaway: Jews were few but highly visible in urban settings. Point forward: why the expulsions happened will come later. -->

---

## What Sources Survive? An Overview

Studying medieval Jewish history requires reading **two bodies of evidence in tandem**:

<v-click>

**Internal (Jewish) sources** — produced by the communities themselves

</v-click>
<v-click>

**External (non-Jewish) sources** — produced by Christian and Muslim authorities

</v-click>
<v-click>

Neither tells the full story alone. Internal sources reflect elite male perspectives; external sources reflect the interests of rulers and churchmen. **Cross-reading** is essential.

</v-click>

<!-- Frame this methodologically: what questions can each type of source answer? What are the blind spots? This sets up the next few slides. -->

---

## Internal Jewish Sources (1): Legal Literature

<v-click>

- **Responsa** (*she’elot u-teshuvot*): written answers by leading rabbinic authorities to legal questions from communities across the diaspora
  - Function as **legal precedents** and windows into daily life
  - Gaonic responsa from Sura and Pumbedita reached communities from Spain to India — parallel to the Islamic institution of the *fatwa*

</v-click>
<v-click>

- **Halakhic codes and commentaries**: Rashi's Talmud commentary (11th c., northern France), Alfasi's *Halakhot* (11th c., Spain/N. Africa), Maimonides' *Mishneh Torah* (12th c., Egypt), Jacob ben Asher's *Arba'ah Turim* (14th c., Spain)

</v-click>
<v-click>

- **Communal statutes** (*takanot*): regulations adopted by individual communities or regional assemblies — e.g. the *takanot* of the ShUM communities (Speyer, Worms, Mainz)
  
</v-click>
<v-click>

- **Custom manuals** (*sifrei minhagim*) **and prayer books**: *Mahzor Vitry* (circle of Rashi), *Sefer Maharil* (Mainz, early 15th c.) — document synagogue rites, communal governance, and social norms; distinct from halakhic codes because they record *practice as lived*, not just law as prescribed

</v-click>

<!-- Define responsa carefully for students with no background: imagine writing a letter to a legal expert and getting a ruling back. Takanot = communal bylaws. Sifrei minhagim = books recording local customs and rites — they tell us what people actually did, not just what they were supposed to do. -->

---

## Internal Jewish Sources (2): Narratives & Poetry

- **Chronicles**: 
  - Rhineland chronicles of the First Crusade (1096) — three accounts (Mainz Anonymous, Solomon bar Simson, Eliezer bar Nathan) documenting attacks and martyrdom
  - *Megillat Achima'az* (11th c., southern Italy): family chronicle in rhymed prose
  - *Sefer ha-Qabbalah* of Abraham ibn Daud: history of rabbinic transmission

<v-click>

- **Travel literature**: Benjamin of Tudela's *Sefer ha-masa'ot* (1165–1173) — a Jewish merchant from Navarre who visited communities from Provence to Mesopotamia and beyond
- **Memorial books** (*memorbücher*): lists of martyrs read during synagogue services — communal memory as liturgical practice

</v-click>
<v-click>

- **Liturgical poetry** (*piyyut*): not just a literary genre — historians now use *piyyutim* and their medieval commentaries as sources for **social history**
- **Exempla stories and folktales**: short illustrative tales embedded in works like *Sefer Hasidim* (~400 exempla) and later collected in the Yiddish *Ma'aseh Buch* — a window into popular mentality, Jewish-Christian interactions, and social tensions beyond the learned elite

</v-click>

<!-- Benjamin of Tudela: our best "census" of 12th-century Jewish communities. The Rhineland chronicles: one of the most powerful bodies of medieval testimony about violence and religious conviction. Piyyut: note the methodological shift — poems once studied only as literature are now read for what they reveal about communal memory, attitudes to martyrdom, and eschatological hopes. -->

---

## Internal Jewish Sources (3): Material and Epigraphic Evidence

- **Tombstone inscriptions** (*matzevot*): Hebrew epitaphs are among the oldest physical traces of Jewish presence in Europe
  - Narbonne tombstone (688 CE) inscribed with שלום על ישראל — one of the earliest Jewish epigraphic finds in France
  - The Würzburg find (1980s): ~1,500 medieval gravestones and fragments discovered in a cellar — pillaged from the cemetery after the Black Death; now a major source for names, titles, family structure, and gender

<v-click>

- **Cemeteries and osteo-archaeology**: the York **Jewbury** excavation (1981) produced demographic data on age, sex ratios, and health for the English Jewish community before the 1290 expulsion — a rare case where human remains supplement textual evidence
- **Archaeological remains**: excavated *mikva'ot* (e.g. the ancient *mikveh* in Syracuse, Sicily), Jewish quarters (Cologne, Regensburg, Speyer), and domestic buildings increasingly complement the written record

</v-click>

<!-- This is a good slide to show images: the Narbonne tombstone, a Würzburg gravestone, the Syracuse mikveh. Emphasise that material sources correct the elite bias of written texts — tombstones record ordinary people, women and children alongside rabbis and merchants. -->

## The Cairo Geniza: A Methodological Revolution

- A **geniza** (from Hebrew *ganaz*, "to store/hide") is a repository for worn-out texts containing God's name, which Jewish law forbids discarding
- The **Ben Ezra Synagogue** in Fustat (Old Cairo) preserved **~250,000 fragments** spanning roughly 1,000 years
- Discovered in the late 19th century; studied systematically by Solomon Schechter (1896) and S. D. Goitein (20th c.)
- Documents include: **private letters, business contracts, court records, marriage deeds, poetry, scientific treatises, children's writing exercises**
- Transforms our knowledge of daily life in the Islamic Mediterranean — the closest we get to hearing "ordinary" medieval Jewish voices

<!-- This is a case study in how a single archival discovery can reshape a field. Emphasise the range of social classes and genders represented — unusual for medieval sources. The Geniza is comparable in importance to the Dead Sea Scrolls for a different period. -->

</figure>

---

## External (Non-Jewish) Sources

- **Royal and ecclesiastical charters**: e.g. Bishop Rüdiger's charter for Speyer Jews (1084), Henry IV's privilege for Speyer and Worms (1090), Carolingian protective letters
- **Canon law**: Theodosian Code (429–438), *Sicut Iudeis* papal bulls, Gratian's *Decretum* (1140), decrees of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215)

<v-click>

- **Secular legal codes**: English *Statute of the Jewry* (1275), German *Landfrieden* (peace decrees), Castilian *Cortes* petitions
- **Administrative and financial records**: the English *Exchequer of the Jews* (*Scaccarium Iudaeorum*) — among the richest archives for Jewish economic history anywhere in medieval Europe
- **Christian chronicles and polemical works**: Thomas of Monmouth's *Life of William of Norwich* (c. 1150); records of disputations (Paris 1240, Barcelona 1263, Tortosa 1413–14)

</v-click>

---

## External (Non-Jewish) Sources (2)

<v-click>

- **Christian narrative and literary sources**: Jews appear in chronicles, sermons, hagiography, and vernacular literature — often as stock figures embodying theological ideas
  - **Hagiography**: Thomas of Monmouth's *Life of William of Norwich* constructs Jews as ritual murderers — a narrative that generated a new saint's cult and a lasting accusation
  - **Courtly literature and drama**: Jews figure in miracle tales (*Cantigas de Santa Maria*, commissioned by Alfonso X) and in passion plays as deicides — shaping popular perception far beyond learned theology
  - **Theological writing**: polemical treatises (Petrus Alphonsi, Peter the Venerable, Raymond Martini's *Pugio fidei*) shaped how Christian intellectuals understood — and misrepresented — Judaism
  - **Visual culture**: the motif of *Ecclesia and Synagoga* (Church triumphant vs. blindfolded Synagogue) on cathedral facades encoded the theological hierarchy in stone
  - These sources are invaluable precisely because they reveal **how the majority imagined Jews** — often at odds with the reality of daily coexistence

</v-click>

<!-- Highlight the paradox: England, which expelled its Jews in 1290, has some of the best-preserved non-Jewish documentation of Jewish life because of royal bureaucratic control over moneylending. The narrative sources are important because they shaped popular attitudes in ways that legal documents alone cannot explain. -->

---

---

## Methodological Reflections

- **The problem of "socially constructed data"**: most data on subordinate groups was generated by dominant groups — can non-Jewish sources tell us about actual Jewish life, or only about Christian *perceptions* of Jews?
- Within the Jewish community too, the **male learned elite** did most of the writing — voices of women, the poor, and the illiterate are filtered through their lenses
- **Language barrier**: Hebrew and Latin — the languages of most sources — were mastered by a small minority even within their own groups

<v-click>

- Two models for writing Jewish history:
  - **Parallel histories** (David Gans, 16th c.): Jewish and non-Jewish history as separate tracks
  - **Integrated approach**: Jewish history inseparable from its wider context
  - Modern compromise: focus on what is specific to Jewish experience while always situating it in the broader historical setting
- Material and epigraphic sources (tombstones, archaeology) help **correct elite bias** — but remain fragmentary

</v-click>

<!-- This is a good moment for discussion: ask students which approach they instinctively prefer, and why. The Fairburn framing is from Shoham-Steiner's chapter in CHJ6 — it's a useful way to sensitise students to the limits of all our evidence. -->

---

## Legal Frameworks: The Deep Background

Jewish legal status rested on **layers of overlapping law**:

| Layer | Key features |
|---|---|
| **Roman law** | Judaism as *religio licita* (permitted religion); Caracalla's edict (212 CE) granted citizenship |
| **Theodosian Code** (429–438) | Protection of cult and property, but new restrictions: no new synagogues, no public office, no conversion of Christian slaves |
| **Justinian Code** (6th c.) | Harsher tone; Jews associated with heretics |
| **Canon law** | Built on the above + conciliar decrees and papal bulls |
| **Secular/feudal law** | Charters, privileges, *Landfrieden*, local customs |

<!-- Walk through the table row by row. The key idea: each layer both protected and restricted. Judaism was never simply "tolerated" or simply "persecuted" — it occupied an unstable middle ground. -->

---

## Augustine's "Witness People" Doctrine

A theological idea with enormous practical consequences:

- **St Augustine of Hippo (d. 430)** argued that Jews must be preserved in Christendom because they carry the Hebrew scriptures that — unwittingly — prove Christian truth
- Typology of **Esau and Jacob** (Genesis 25:23): "the elder shall serve the younger" — Jews (the older brother) must serve Christians (the younger)

<v-click>

- This became the foundation of the papal *Sicut Iudeis* formula (first attributed to Gregory the Great, 598): Jews should suffer **no unlawful injury**, but they must not **exceed their prescribed role**
- The doctrine justified both **protection** (Jews must survive as witnesses) and **subordination** (they must remain visibly inferior)
- It shaped policy for centuries — until the 13th-century discovery of the Talmud raised the question: if Jews follow rabbinic law rather than the Bible, does the rationale for tolerating them still hold?

</v-click>

<!-- This is one of the single most important ideas for understanding Jewish life in Latin Christendom. Return to it whenever discussing legal status, distinguishing marks, or expulsions. -->

---

## From Protection to Dependence: *Servi Camerae*

- Early medieval rulers issued **protective charters** to Jewish merchants (Carolingian era: Louis the Pious, 814–840)
- These gradually evolved into a relationship of **direct legal dependence** on the ruler

<v-click>

- **1157**: Frederick I ratifies a charter for Worms Jews: *"cum ad cameram nostram attineant"* ("since they belong to our chamber")
- **1236**: Frederick II calls Jews *servi camerae nostrae* ("servants of our royal chamber") — not slaves, but the ruler's personal fiscal resource
- France: *Iudaei nostri* ("our Jews") — organic process of concentrating power; a Jew who fled to another lord's territory could be "seized back"
- England: no special term needed — centralised monarchy already controlled Jewish finance directly

</v-click>
<v-click>

- The ruler **guaranteed** security, freedom of worship, and internal jurisdiction
- But also claimed the **right to tax at will**, cancel debts, or confiscate property

</v-click>

<!-- The key tension: protection and exploitation were two sides of the same coin. This explains why Jewish fortunes rose and fell with the political strength (and fiscal appetite) of their protectors. -->

---

## Economic Life: Beyond the Stereotype

Jewish economic activities were **far more diverse** than the moneylender stereotype suggests:

| Sector | Where and when | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Agriculture** | Iberia, Provence, Italy (9th–12th c.) | Vineyards, olive groves, grain |
| **Crafts** | Mediterranean especially | Dyeing, tanning, silk, coral, glassmaking |
| **Trade** | Ashkenaz (10th–12th c.) | Wine, spices, textiles, livestock, metalware |
| **Medicine** | Everywhere | Court physicians, surgeons, midwives |
| **Moneylending** | From 12th c.; exclusive in England | Small pawns to large royal loans |
| **Administration** | Iberia especially | Tax farming, diplomacy, minting |


<!-- Challenge the students: if someone says "medieval Jews were moneylenders," what's wrong with that statement? Answer: it's true for a specific time and place, but wildly inaccurate as a generalisation. -->

---

## The Shift to Moneylending

Why did moneylending become dominant in northern Europe?

<v-clicks>

1. **Urbanisation and commercial revolution** (12th–13th c.): Christian merchants formed guilds from which Jews were excluded
2. **Church ban on Christian usury** (any interest): created a niche — but also stigmatised those who filled it
3. **Rulers found it profitable**: Jews as lenders could be taxed heavily; rulers had full visibility into their wealth
4. **Rising demand for credit**: knights financing crusades, cathedral-building, agricultural development

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

- The shift was **gradual**: in Germany not complete until mid-13th c.; in the Mediterranean, Jews retained diverse occupations much longer
- Internal Jewish adaptations: *iska* (partnership contract circumventing the biblical ban on lending at interest to fellow Jews), *maarufia* (monopoly on a specific client)

</v-click>

<!-- Emphasise that this was not a Jewish "choice" but the result of structural pressures. Also note the irony: the Church created the niche and then condemned those who filled it. -->

---

## The Fiscal Trap

Moneylending gave Jews political leverage — but also made them vulnerable:

- Jewish **tax contributions were disproportionate**: in Germany (1241), Jews paid ~13 % of all taxes while constituting < 1 % of the population
- Rulers used Jewish debts as **political instruments**: cancelling debts to reward allies (e.g. Wenceslaus IV in Bohemia, 1385 and 1390), confiscating estates of deceased lenders

<v-click>

- England: **Aaron of Lincoln** (d. 1186) — died the richest man in England; a special branch of the royal treasury (*Scaccarium Aronis*) spent five years sorting his assets
- As **Christian banking** developed (Italian lombards, Castilian *censal* annuities), Jews lost their monopoly and their wealthiest clients
- Clientele shifted downward: from kings and nobles to **artisans and peasants** — smaller loans, higher risk, greater social resentment

</v-click>

<!-- The "fiscal trap": the very activity that made Jews indispensable also generated the resentment that made them expendable once alternatives appeared. -->

---

## Distinguishing Marks and Sumptuary Laws

- **Fourth Lateran Council (1215), Canon 68**: Jews and Muslims must be distinguishable from Christians by dress — to prevent accidental sexual mixing

<v-click>

- Implementation varied by ruler:
  - **France**: *rouelle* (circular badge), enforced from 1269
  - **England**: *tabula* (tablets of the Law), from 1253
  - **Germany**: pointed hat (*Judenhut*) — Jews were already wearing it; sometimes used as exemption from the badge
  - **Provence**: *capa rotunda* (rounded hood) — criticised because it resembled clerical garb

</v-click>
<v-click>

- Enforcement was **inconsistent** — rulers sometimes sold exemptions
- The badge served a double function: **marking inferiority** and **generating revenue** from dispensations

</v-click>

<!-- Ask students: what does it tell us that enforcement was so patchy? It suggests that in daily life, Jews and Christians were often not easily distinguishable — which is precisely why the Church felt legislation was needed. -->

---

## Two Cultural Worlds: Ashkenaz and Sefarad

| | **Ashkenaz** | **Sefarad** |
|---|---|---|
| **Language** | Hebrew/Aramaic for learning; vernacular glosses (Old French, early Yiddish) | Judeo-Arabic for scholarship and daily life; Hebrew for poetry |
| **Intellectual focus** | Talmud commentary, legal creativity (Rashi, Tosafists) | Philosophy, science, grammar, secular poetry alongside halakhah |
| **Attitude to philosophy** | Suspicion; pietism (*Chasidei Ashkenaz*) | Embrace; rationalism (Sa'adya, Maimonides) |
| **Communal leadership** | Rabbinic families; no supra-communal hierarchy | Courtier-scholars (*nagid*, *nasi*); oligarchic communal councils |
| **Relations with majority** | Sharper boundary; martyrdom ideal (*kiddush ha-Shem*) | Greater cultural integration; participation in courtly life |

<!-- This table is deliberately simplified to give students a framework. Warn them it's a starting point, not a final word. -->

---

## Ashkenaz: Piety, Learning, and Martyrdom

- **Rashi of Troyes** (c. 1040–1105): author of the standard commentaries on the Hebrew Bible and the Babylonian Talmud — studied in the Rhineland, returned to Champagne
- His grandsons **Rabbenu Tam** and **Rashbam** continued the tradition of the **Tosafists** — dialectical glosses on the Talmud

<v-click>

- **Chasidei Ashkenaz** ("the Pietists of Ashkenaz"): 12th–13th c. movement centred on the Kalonymide family
  - Key figures: Judah he-Hasid (1150–1217), Eleazar of Worms
  - Emphasis on discovering God's hidden will beyond the letter of the law; penitential practices (*teshuvat ha-mishqal*)
  - *Sefer Hasidim*: a rich collection of pietistic teachings and stories documenting intimate Jewish-Christian interactions

</v-click>
<v-click>

- The **1096 massacres** gave rise to a powerful martyrdom ideal: *kiddush ha-Shem* (sanctification of God's Name) — communities chose death over forced baptism
  - Commemorated in chronicles, liturgical poems, and *memorbücher*

</v-click>

<!-- Rashi's commentaries are still printed in every standard edition of the Talmud today — that's the scale of his influence. The 1096 martyrdom narratives are among the most intense texts in medieval literature. -->

---

## Sefarad: Courts, Poetry, and Philosophy

- **Al-Andalus "Golden Age"** (10th–12th c.): Hasdai ibn Shaprut as courtier-patron; literary salons (*majalis*); Hebrew poetry adopting Arabic metres
  - Poets: Dunash ben Labrat, Samuel ha-Nagid (also a military commander), Solomon ibn Gabirol, Judah ha-Levi

<v-click>

- Under **Christian rule** (12th–15th c.): Jews served as administrators, tax farmers, translators, physicians
  - Remarkable **communal autonomy**: Jewish courts had jurisdiction over criminal matters, including — controversially — the right to execute informers (*malshinim*)
  - Intellectual life: Nachmanides, Solomon ibn Adret (Rashba), the *Arba'ah Turim* of Jacob ben Asher

</v-click>
<v-click>

- **Maimonides** (Moses ben Maimon, d. 1204): born in Cordoba, fled Almohad persecution, settled in Egypt
  - Court physician, halakhist (*Mishneh Torah*), philosopher (*Guide of the Perplexed*)
  - His work provoked the **Maimonidean controversies** (1232, 1300–1306) — debates over the place of philosophy in Jewish education, centred in Provence

</v-click>

<!-- Maimonides is the towering figure. Note that his life itself illustrates the mobility and cross-cultural reach of medieval Jewish intellectuals: born in Muslim Spain, educated in Morocco, working in Fatimid Egypt. -->

---

## Provence: The Bridge Zone

- Geographically and culturally between Ashkenaz and Sefarad
- Home to the **Ibn Tibon translation movement**: Judah ibn Tibon, Samuel ibn Tibon, Moses ibn Tibon translated major works from Judeo-Arabic into Hebrew
  - Made Maimonides, Aristotle, Averroes, and Avicenna accessible to non-Arabic-reading Jews

<v-click>

- Also the **birthplace of kabbalah** as a literary movement:
  - *Sefer ha-Bahir* (late 12th c.): emerged in the circle of Isaac the Blind (son of Abraham ben David of Posquières)
  - Concept of *sefirot* — divine emanations through which God relates to the world
  - From Provence, kabbalah spread to Catalonia (Girona: Nachmanides, Azriel) and Castile

</v-click>
<v-click>

- Provencal scholars consciously **integrated** Talmudic learning with philosophy and science — a deliberate curricular programme, not just individual curiosity

</v-click>

<!-- Provence shows that the Ashkenaz/Sefarad binary, while useful, doesn't capture everything. This region produced its own synthesis. -->

---

## Communal Organisation: The *Kehillah*

The *kehillah* (Jewish community) was the **basic unit of Jewish collective life** — simultaneously a religious congregation, a court, an economic corporation, and a mutual-aid society.

<v-click>

- **Legal basis**: privileges granted by Christian or Muslim rulers giving Jews internal jurisdiction
- **Core institutions**:
  - **Synagogue** — worship, assembly, and sometimes court sessions
  - ***Mikveh*** (ritual bath) — essential for family purity laws
  - ***Shechita*** (ritual slaughter) — supervised kosher meat supply
  - **Cemetery** — sometimes shared across a region (e.g. the ShUM cemetery network)

</v-click>
<v-click>

- **Charitable societies**: care of the sick (*cholim*), education (*Talmud Torah*), dowries for poor brides, ransoming of captives, lighting of the synagogue
- Communities were **largely self-governing** — but the degree of autonomy varied enormously by region

</v-click>

<!-- Define kehillah, mikveh, shechita for students unfamiliar with these terms. Stress that the kehillah was not just a "congregation" in the modern sense — it was closer to a small municipality with its own taxes, courts, and welfare system. -->

---

## Leadership: Who Ran the Community?

| Region | Model | Key features |
|---|---|---|
| **Islamic lands** | Gaonic academies + Exilarchate | Centralised authority; geonim issued rulings for the entire diaspora |
| **Sefarad** | Courtier-oligarchy | Wealthy families dominated; *rab de la corte* as royal liaison; wide criminal jurisdiction |
| **Ashkenaz** | Rabbinic families (*mishpachot meyuchasot*) | No supra-communal hierarchy; decisions made per community (*bet din*); inter-communal coordination through ShUM *takanot* |
| **Provence** | *Nesi'im* → merchant *parnasim* | Narbonne's quasi-aristocratic *nesi'im* gave way to commercial leadership in the 13th c. |

<v-click>

- **Tensions**: in Spain especially, lower and middle classes fought for a say in communal governance — particularly over **tax distribution**
- **Rabbinic courts** (*batei din*) handled civil disputes; their authority was sometimes recognised by non-Jewish courts (e.g. English courts enforcing the *ketubbah* — the marriage contract)

</v-click>

<!-- This slide works well with v-click to first show the table, then discuss the tensions. Ask students: what happens when the people who govern the community are also the wealthiest? -->

---

## Daily Coexistence: The Other Side of the Story

Medieval Jewish-Christian relations were **not only** a story of persecution:

<v-click>

- **Economic cooperation**: Jews and Christians were business partners, shared marketplaces, and employed each other's workers
- **Domestic proximity**: in many towns, Jews and Christians lived in the same streets, owned property in each other's quarters
- **Cultural exchange**: *Sefer Hasidim* documents Jews and Christians aware of each other's religious practices, sometimes attending each other's celebrations

</v-click>
<v-click>

- **Obadiah the Convert** (Norman Italy, 12th c.): a Christian priest and son of a Norman knight who converted to Judaism — he adapted church melodies for synagogue use; his autograph musical notations survive in the Cairo Geniza
- **Provencal pragmatism**: Menachem ha-Meiri of Perpignan (1249–1316) argued that Christianity cannot be classified as idolatry (*avodah zarah*) — Christians belong among "nations bound by religious principles"
- Jewish litigants in Provence **often preferred Christian courts** to rabbinic ones

</v-click>

<!-- This slide is deliberately placed after the legal-economic material to complicate the narrative. Students may have formed an impression of unrelenting hostility — this corrects it. -->

---

## Violence and Expulsion: Patterns and Causes

Major waves of anti-Jewish violence:

| Date | Event | Region |
|---|---|---|
| **1096** | First Crusade massacres | Rhineland (Mainz, Worms, Cologne): ~3,000 killed |
| **1144–1255** | Blood-libel accusations | England (Norwich, Lincoln), France (Blois 1171) |
| **1298** | Rintfleisch massacres | Franconia: ~5,000 killed |
| **1348–51** | Black Death pogroms | Most of the Holy Roman Empire |
| **1391** | Anti-Jewish riots | Castile and Aragon: mass forced conversions |

<v-click>

- These events were **not random** — they correlated with political instability, fiscal pressure, crusade mobilisation, and plague anxiety
- But they were also shaped by **theological developments**: blood-libel accusations, host-desecration charges, and (from the 13th c.) doubts about whether Jews still qualified as Augustine's "witness people"

</v-click>

<!-- Don't rush this slide — the human cost is staggering. Pause after the table. The 1096 chroniclers describe parents killing their own children rather than submitting to baptism. -->

---

## Why Were Jews Expelled? A Comparative View

| | **England (1290)** | **France (1306/1394)** | **Spain (1492)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Political driver** | Centralised monarchy; Edward I bows to Church pressure | Philip IV seizes Jewish assets to fund wars | Inquisition concludes Jewish presence corrupts *conversos* |
| **Economic context** | Jewish lending no longer needed; Italian bankers available | Royal treasury enriched by confiscating debts | Jewish fiscal importance had declined; *censal* replacing Jewish loans in Aragon |
| **Church role** | *Statute of the Jewry* (1275) already banned lending | Campaigns against Talmud; preaching of friars | Mendicant preaching; *converso* problem |
| **Common thread** | In all cases, expulsion came when **rulers no longer depended on Jewish fiscal contributions** enough to resist ecclesiastical and popular pressure |

<!-- This comparative slide is designed to provoke discussion. Ask: what do these three cases share? What differs? The common thread at the bottom can appear on click. -->

## Conclusion: Why Study the Jewish Middle Ages?

<v-click>

- The medieval period was **formative for modern Judaism**: halakhah, liturgy, communal structures, and intellectual traditions all took shapes that endure today

</v-click>
<v-click>

- Jews occupied a **unique position** in medieval societies — studying them illuminates wider questions of identity, economic organisation, and interreligious contact
